title: Scrum Project Idea

## Purpose
Our plan is to make a platform, called Striver, where peoples are able to track their own personal goals and be able to check on the goals of their peers. Essentially our website would operate like a social media site for motivation and self gain.

## Planning
We decided to plan this by contributing on a google drawing to get an idea of how we will attack this idea. We decided to also meet up with each other over the week end so that we can collaborate on a more intimate level so we could effectively share our ideas.

## Goal
In the end we hope to come up with a good looking website that will allow the community to post about their goals for the near future and keep tabs on their friends and peers on their own goals

## My roles
With my role as the frontend operator I plan to take care of the asthetics of our website. I will ensure the functionality of our project and make sure all aspects are up to standards and work in a practical way. I will ensure an easy to understand and operational website that users will be able to function on.
