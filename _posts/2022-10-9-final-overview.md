## Purpose
Our plan is to make a platform, called Striver, where can view various motivational and inspirational quotes. Essentially our website would operate like a social media site for motivation and self gain.

## Planning
We decided to plan this by contributing on a google drawing to get an idea of how we will attack this idea. We decided to also meet up with each other over the week end so that we can collaborate on a more intimate level so we could effectively share our ideas.

## Purpose and Function
- Website that displays inspirational quotes
- Users can view these quotes to find motivation and can like the quotes and share

## Data Abstraction
- We will store users like patterns and users information in lists

## Managing Complexity
- The program we will be creating will contain a list of specific users like and quotes that are essential to contain in out code segment

## Procedural Abstraction
- We will use different HTML templates for different views for the users

## Algorithm Implementation
- Our program will involve lists and arrays to determine the path and options for users to navigate the through the website

## Testing
- We will use print statements for debugging to make sure everything works orderly
