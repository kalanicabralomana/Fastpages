# Program Design and Development

## Video 1: 
- Computer programs are developed with a systematic approach to meet design elements.
    - starts with an idea
    - follow specific steps and stick to a plan
- Dev Process can be ordered and intentional or exploratory. 
Phases of the dev process include:
    - investigating/reflecting
    - designing
    - prototyping
    - testing
- Developers must determine the program requirements and constraints
- revisiting earlier phases of the process allows refinement and revision based on feedback and testing
- Break down your problem/coding process into numerous pieces and make sure each piece works before combining the program as a whole.
- investigation is useful to identify the program constraints and concerns for the user.
    - Collecting data with survey
    - user testing
    - interviews
    - Direct Observations 
- Program requirements describe user interactions and program functions 
    - include user interactions and create an outline of them
- Design phase of development outlines how they will accomplish a given program goal/specification
    - brainstorming
    - planning and creating a storyboard
    - organizing the program into modules and functional components
    - creation of diagrams that represent the layouts of the user interface
    - dev of a testing strategy for the program.

## Video 2:
- Programs are developed by groups of people and are expanded upon by individuals.
    - Rarely developed solely by a single individual. (teams are more common)
    - Individuals work on a specific component of the program or code segment.
        - Each member of a team should receive credit in the documentation of the program
- Always acknowledge when you are using a code segment from an outside source.
    - Do this by writing the original authors name in the program documentation.
    - Some languages have the ability to leave a comment within the code, to give credit.
        - comments make it easy to find out who is responsible to fix a specific problem
        - After the program is completed, you can find additional bugs.
- Sometimes developers use code segments, procedures, algorithms that were written by others.
    - Even if they are not part of the project, they deserve credit, because it is considered intellectual property. 
    - Documentation of contributors resembles a works cited list.

## Video 3: 
- Programs use comments and documentation to explain the purpose of their programs to themselves and others
- Program documentation is a written description of a function of a code segment, event, procedure, or program and how it was developed.
    - Describe the overall program specifications, its development, how other programs interact with yours, and the contributors.
- You Should document your program throughout the development
    - At the beginning, list specifications
    - During, keep track of your progress
    - After, explain the overall  process
- Documentation helps maintain correct programs, so you can easily review what you or collaborators did.
    - Improves efficiency, and ability to test and refine your program.
- If there is no comment feature in the language, you have to get creative
    - Comments allow programmers to write text within the program, does not affect the program.
    - Python: # is a comment
    - Java: // is a single line comment, /* is multiple line, /** documentation comments
    - Javascript, C++, Swift use the same as java
    - HTML and XML use <!""!>
