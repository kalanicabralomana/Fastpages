# Overview

Today we met ambassadors from Cal State San Marcos and they gave a presentation about CSUSM and the opportunities available to students. The presenters were and are hardworking people who never let failures define them. CSUSM is a a great university where many people can pursue various majors, including Applied Physics, Physics, Chemistry and Biochemistry, Biotechnology, Biological Studies, Math, Computer Science, Software Engineering, and Electrical Engineering. The presentation also touched on CSUSM's clubs, such as the Cyber Security club, Robotics club, 3D printing club, Women in STEM, Society of Physics Students, and National Society of Black Engineers. The importance of internships was emphasized, and the presentation provided advice on how to find them, such as joining clubs, checking emails, attending campus events, and utilizing Google. It was recommended to avoid unpaid internships. Finally, the presentation highlighted two programs, the Summer Scholar Program, which is a ten-week summer program that pays its participants, and the Quantum Bridge Program, which is a paid program for admitted CSUSM students.

# Reflection

Throughout this whole panel i have gained insights in the life of a college student and what it may be like when pursuing STEM in a higher education. As a student looking to pursue a STEM career in the future, the presentation was highly informative and motivating. The presenters' emphasis on persistence and hard work despite facing failures is something that I will take as advice. It was encouraging to learn about the wide range of majors available at CSUSM. The presentation also highlighted the various clubs available on campus which provide excellent opportunities to connect with other students and participate in certain activities. Overall, the presentation has motivated me to consider CSUSM as a college I may look into and to take advantage of the various resources available on campus to further my education and career goals.
