# Project: Stiver

We made Striver, a program that acts as a website where can view various motivational and inspirational quotes. Essentially our website operated like a social media site for motivation and self gain.

We viewed a different project called Scheduler, made by a group from the other P4 class. Their program helps user build a schedule and plan their future events for future reference

## Art projects

After presenting I walked around the other projects and found my way into the art room. I saw some really nice paintings and drawing and found this one really cool. I really liked the concept of global warming through the form of art.

## Overall thoughts
- I really enjoys N@M because we got to see all of our peers hard work and the excitement of being able to showcase our work
