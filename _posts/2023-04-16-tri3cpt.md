# Tri 3 CPT Write-Up

## 3a. Program Purpose and Function

## i. Describes the overall purpose of the program.
The purpose of the program is to create a way for users to test their luck with the Roulette casino game.

# ii. Describes what functionality of the program is demonstrated in the video.
The video shows a user playing through the game while aslo 

## iii. Describes the input and output of the program demonstrated in the video.
The inputs in the video are the user typing in the username, creating the user, placing coins on board, spinning board, and loading user. The outputs demonstrated in the video are the winning/losing square, and change in coins for the user.

# 3b. Data Abstraction

# i. The first program code segment must show how data have been stored in the list.

## ii. The second program code segment must show the data in the same list being used, such as creating new data from the existing data or accessing multiple elements in the list, as part of fulfilling the program's purpose

## iii. Identifies the name of the list being used in this response.
The name of the list being used is "game.eles"

## iv. Describes what the data contained in the list represent in your program.
The data in "game.eles" is the the square elements on the game board, the numbers that users can bet on in the game.

## v. Explains how the selected list manages complexity in your program code by explaining why your program code could not be written, or how it would be written differently, if you did not use the list.
"game.eles" manages complexity by storing all of the different squares that a user can bet on into an array. This is crucial because it allows the program to be able to generate a random value within the the array to pick the winning square. This allows to the avoidance of having to use many variable to store each element in "game.eles" which would be difficult to manage due to the amount of elements. The program could not be written without "game.eles" because it it used to access, style, and manipulate elements throughout the program.

## 3c

# i. The first program code segment must be a student-developed procedure that:- Defines the procedure's name and return type (if necessary)- Contains and uses one or more parameters that have an effect on the functionality of the procedure

## ii. The second program code segment must show where your student-developed procedure is being called in your program.

## iii. Describes in general what the identified procedure does and how it contributes to the overall functionality of the program.
The procedure identified is "createEle". The identified procedure allows for the process of creating new HTML elements allowing to define many properties of the new element in a single function.
