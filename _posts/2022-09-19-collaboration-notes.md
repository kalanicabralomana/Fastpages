# Collaboration Notes

## The importance of collaboration
- Multiple perspectives working together to find a better solution
- Improves communication skills
- Improves productivity and a chance to learn from one another

## Video 1.1
- Kensuke and Tanabe and Shigeru Miyambo worked together to make both games (collaborating)
- Tanabe was level designer while Miyamoto was director (different roles in a team)
- Collaboration between the two was able to make a good game including both of their talents and perspectives

## How to Collaborate
- Pair programming
    - Two Programmers work together as a pair. One writes the program while the other obeserves and navigates (reviews code as its typped in)
- Think-Pair-Share
    - Students think through a problem alone, pair with a partner to share ideas and they form a result to share with class
- Collaboration tools
    - Github (collaborate with repos), peer testing and feedback, shared documents and folders, repl.it (code together in same workspace)
