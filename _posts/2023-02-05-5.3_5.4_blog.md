# 5.3: Computing Bias

Facebook: 25-34 aged
TikTok: 10-19 aged
In my opinion, I think that there is no purposeful exclusion but they do target a specific demographic. 
Yes, I think that it could be harmful because we have a large group of young people all being influenced by one app.
Yes, I think that it should be corrected.
Yes, I think that it’s good business because they are successful and make a lot of revenue off of people's time.

I think that virtual assistants have female voices because society has this idea that men are superior to women, and that women belong as assistants. I think that it is purposeful because of societal norms. I think that it could be harmful because young people can be influenced by the idea and associate women with being assistants. I think that it should be corrected by requesting a female or male voice instead of setting a default. I think that it is good business because they are appealing to society.

Personalized advertisements are an algorithm that influences my decisions since they usually appeal to what I watch/enjoy and encourage me to click/ show interest.

I do not think that it was intentional because the engineers that were working and testing the camera were probably all white so they didn’t have the correct samples to test different skin tones. I think that it can be harmful to develop technology that can’t operate under all circumstances in which it was meant to because it can unintentionally exclude certain groups from being included. Yes, I think that it should be corrected because a certain group should never be excluded due to something that they can’t control. To produce a better outcome they could retest with different skin tones to generate a more accurate response.
