# HTML Fragments

## Changing Theme from Minima to Leap Day

When I changed my theme from Minima to Leap Day, the first thing I 
noticed was that all the colors changed. I also noticed that all of my 
posts moved to the left of my fastpages site. I also noticed that the 
formatting and text font changed. I liked how the title of my site was 
centered at the top of my screen. The only thing that I didn't liek was 
how there is empty space on the right side of the site. Overall I like 
how nicer and cleaner the theme is compared to minima.

## Search Feature

When using the search page I am able to type in any key word 
that shows up throughout my fastpages website. In this case, I 
typed in fastpages and the page outputs links to any post, 
notebook, page and/or markdown that contains fastpages in it.

## Tags

As you can see I have tags for notesbooks that incule code in 
them as well as corresponding weeks for the different 
assignments.
