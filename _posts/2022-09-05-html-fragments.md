# HTML Fragments
## Changing Theme from Minima to Hacker
![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/frontpage.jpg "https://github.com/fastai/fastpages")

When I changes my theme from Minima to Hacker, I noticed that all of the indents for the text 
was removed and all the text was shifted to the left. I also noticed that any text that has 
an embedded link turned blue (links on the top of the front page were condensed on the left).
