# Reflection

![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/2018mc.png "https://github.com/fastai/fastpages")

I scored a 63/66, 95%

# Q1
![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/2018q1.png "https://github.com/fastai/fastpages")

My answer: (A) 

Correct answer: (B) 

This option is incorrect. The code segment assigns the initial value of first to temp, then assigns the initial value of second to first. The initial value of second, which has been stored in first, is then assigned to second. Therefore, the value of second has not changed from its initial value.

# Q11
![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/2018q11.png "https://github.com/fastai/fastpages")

My answer: (C)

Correct answer: (D)

This option is incorrect. The code segment selects "Red" one-sixth of the time, "Yellow" one-sixth of the time, and "Blue" the remaining two-thirds of the time.

# Q41
![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/2018q41.png "https://github.com/fastai/fastpages")

My answer: (A)

Correct answer: (B)

This option is incorrect. This expression assigns only one score to One word, adjusted Total.

## Conclusion
Overall I am feeling ready for the MCQ for the AP exam. One thing I am worried about is the timing of the test. I need to fix my pacing for each question as I see myself taking longer on some questions. I also need to double check my answers since I see myself misinterpreting some questions.
