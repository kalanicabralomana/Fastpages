### Reflection
I scored this submission a 5 out of 6 in the Program Purpose and Function category, while the College Board gave them a 4 out of 6. I thought that the student had correctly described the purpose of the program, but it turns out that they only described its functionality. The student did not receive a point in this category because they did not explain the purpose of the program, but they did meet all the other requirements. As a result, they received a score of 0 out of 1 because there is no partial credit. In order to improve their score, they should include a code segment that utilizes a list to manage complexity, such as iterating through a list to check or change something.

### Reflection
There were no discrepancies between my scoring and the College Board's AP scoring for this student. Both of us gave them a score of 6 out of 6. I believe that the student was very thorough in including all the necessary requirements and in the descriptions of the code segments in the relevant categories. In order to receive a point for Procedural Abstraction in my own program, I need to include a procedure that has at least one parameter and plays an important role in the program. I should also aim to include all the other elements that this student included in their submission, as they received full marks in the scoring. It is important to carefully follow the specific criteria for each category and make sure that all the requirements are met in my own performance task. This student did not miss the standard.
