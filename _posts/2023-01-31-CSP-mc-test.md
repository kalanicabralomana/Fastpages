### Reflection
After I took took the test I got three questions wrong. One where I had to investigate the task, evaluate and test algorithms, and develop and implement algorithms. After looking at my answer then looking at the algorithm I can see that my answer is impossible. The arrow would never be able to hit the box that I chose. I think this mistake as a matter of misreading the code. After reading the answer I can see where I went wrong. I think that I made this mistake by misunderstanding and getting lost and the extent of the code. I can recognize that I may have to draw out longer segments of code like this one to break it down and understand it.
