# Overview
On Tuesday 12/13 we met 2 wonderful speakers, Kathyleen Beveridge (Project Management) and Kris Porter (Developer Operation). We learned about their very own steps to becoming the person they are today and how they have used their experience and education to advance in their fields of work. I found it really interesting how both speakers never really stayed in one field of study or field of work. They are always learning new concepts and learning new aspects in their fields of work.
