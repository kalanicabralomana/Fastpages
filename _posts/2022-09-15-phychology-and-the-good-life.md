# "Psychology and the Good Life" Notes and Insights

## Insight #1: We can improve our well-being
The first insight that I took away from the video was controlling our well-being. I never knew how much control over our well-being we actually had. In a study talked about in the video, she states that around 50% of our well-being is determined by our genes. This means that people have the chance to control their well-being around half the time and affect their lives in a positive way

## Insight #2: Stop worrying about the little things in life
Another insight I had while watching the video was how life circumstances don't really affect our lives as much as we think. She talks about how these short instances in our life may affect our happiness present time when it happens but later on it takes zero control on our well-being. What we usually think will make us happy doesn't make us as happy as we would think.

## Insight #3: The importance of being with other people
In the video she mentions how happy people spend their time. It is discovered that happy people tend to spend their time around other while more unhappy people would rather spend their time alone and away from others and social interaction. She mentions a study where people that were put into a situation where they had to connect with strangers for a long period of time and they measured that their overall well being was more positive than the people that were stuck in solitary.

## Insight #4: The importance of good deeds and helping other
Happy people tend to spend their time to help others. She mentions how treating and helping others has a greater affect on a persons well-being than it would if a person were to treat themselves. She mentions a study where people were given money to either help themselves or help other and the study shows that the people that helped others were significantly more happy in the end than the people that helps themselves.

## Insight #5: Be present in the moment
In the video she talks about realizing what you are doing and focusing is important for you well-being. It also means taking time to realize you gratitude and what it really means to be where you are presently in that moment.
