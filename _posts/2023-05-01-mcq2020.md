I scored a 66/67, 98%

# Q11

My answer: (B) 

Correct answer: (A) 

This option is incorrect. TThe binary RGB triplet for light yellow is (11111111, 11111111, 11100000). I just need to work on my identification of binary numbers

## Conclusion
Overall I am feeling ready for the MCQ for the AP exam. One thing I am worried about is the timing of the test. I need to fix my pacing for each question as I see myself taking longer on some questions. I also need to double check my answers since I see myself misinterpreting some questions.
