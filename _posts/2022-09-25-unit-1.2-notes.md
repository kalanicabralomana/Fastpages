# Program Function and Purpose Notes

## Video #1

- Programs are developed with a purpose (solve problems)
- Innovation categories
    - Applications (games)
    - Systems (email)
    - Physical Devices (gaming consoles, phones)
- Being able to understand the purpose of a program is essential to improve a programmers ability to improve the function.


## Video #2

- Programs inputs are date sent to computers for processing by the program
- Events are associated with an action and supplies input data to a program
- Events are generated by a defined action
- Program statements are executed when triggered
- Program output is data sent from a programs input to a device in the form of visual/text/audio

## Video #3

- Program is a collection of statements that perform a task when run (software)
- A code segment is a collection of code statements, according to the rules of a programming language
    - To describe it: Simply state what the segment does, so someone else can use it without reading the whole thing
- A program must work for a variety of inputs and situations
- The behavior of a program is how a program functions during its execution (how a user interacts with it)
- Programs are described by what the program does and how its statements accomplish the function.
