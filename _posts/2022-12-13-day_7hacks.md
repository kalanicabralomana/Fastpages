### First Library
Pandas: Pandas is a popular Python library for data analysis and manipulation. It provides powerful tools and data structures for working with structured and unstructured data, such as tabular data (e.g. data in tables), time series data, and more. Pandas makes it easy to clean, transform, and analyze large datasets, and is widely used in the field of data science and machine learning.

### Second Library
Keras: Keras is a high-level neural networks API, written in Python and capable of running on top of TensorFlow, CNTK, or Theano. It provides a simple and intuitive interface for building and training deep learning models, and is designed to be modular and extensible, making it easy to experiment with different architectures and algorithms. Keras is widely used in the field of deep learning and computer vision, and is a powerful tool for building and training complex neural networks.
