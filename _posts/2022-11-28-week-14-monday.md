# Variables
-dos when naming variable: make it simple

Types of data
- Integer: numbers
- Text/string: words
- Boolean: Data that determines if something is true or false

Data can be stored in variables
- so that you ca print retrieve specific values in the list w/o creating many variables
- easy to remove/add/change items into the list

# Assignments
Operators: allows a program to change the value represented by a variable (=,+=,-=,*=,/=,**=)
Values can be stored in a variable

**DO THE 3 HW PROBLEMS ON ASSIGNMENTS*

# Data Abtraction
- Method used to represent data in a useful form, by taking wy of data that aren't being used int eh situation
- Variables and lsts are tools usied in data abstraction
- It provides a separation between the abstract properties of data type and concrete details of its representation

# Lists and strings
- list: ordered sequesnt of elements
- element: individual value in a list that is assigned to a unique index
- index: a way to reference the elements in a list or string using natural numebrs; each element of a string is referenced by an index
- string: orderedsequanc of charaters (etters, numbers, special charaters)
- lists can be used to store multiple elements

**DO THE DATA ABSTRACTON PRACTICE* hint use for loop
