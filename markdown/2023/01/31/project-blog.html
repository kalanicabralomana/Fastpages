<p>The College Board performance tasks require that we fulfill all project specifications, including appropriateness and demonstration of programming skills through a written report and video. This includes showcasing the program’s purpose and functionality, managing complexity, utilizing algorithms and procedures, testing, and providing detailed descriptions to show proficiency in the project and AP CSP curriculum.</p>

<p>For our CPT group project we have been working on creating an arcade like website where people can connect with other players and play a game of chess or ticktac toe. It will have many different aspects to the game such as a wins, moves, and effects to the user. There will also be a mandatory feature where users will need to sign in to be able to play so that their profile can update with their wins/losses.</p>

<p>For my personal addition to this project I will be mainly working on the game part for the the website. I will have sure to hit every single one of the scoring sections of the CPT rubric, and I think I’m making good progress towards that. I am already settled down on the program purpose and functionality, and this will be explicitly described in my writeup &amp; my video. Furthermore, I will be able to test it, and after creating the backend of the score and time tracker page and after it is fully functional, I will be able to go in-depth to describe the algorithms which were utilized, how complexity was managed using lists, and how my backend is secure and utilizes many different complex programming methodologies.In the video I will show how depending on what object you click how it will effect your profile</p>

<p>Program Purpose and function: The purpose of the program would provide the user with a view to their account providing them with information about their wins and losses connecting them to their game history.</p>

<p>Data Abstraction: The program abstracts data through the creation of games in a database. The database stores information about the user, their account, their games, ad w/l they have. This can be used to create an overview of their account and w/l.</p>

<p>Managing Complexity: We will have many ways to record their gameplay and store their gamplay.</p>

<p>Procedural Abstraction: We will do this in our games and how the game can be played, with the use of functions with a parameter.</p>

<p>Algorithm Implementation: This will also be displayed in our games sine they will include sequencing selection and iteration, in our chess, blackjack, and tic tac toe.</p>

<p>Testing: We will show this through our features beign the games with different inputs and outputs</p>
