<p><strong>Bits</strong>: A bit or a binary digit, is the smallest unit of data that a computer can process and store. A bit can be one of 2 physical states, such as either 0 or 1, yes or no, and true or false.</p>

<p><strong>Bytes</strong>: A byte is a unit of data that is eight bits long. It is used by computers to represent a character such as a letter or number symbol.</p>

<p><strong>Hexadecimal</strong>: Hexadecimal is a numbering system with base 16. There are 16 symbols or possible digit values from 0 to 9, followed by six alphabetic characters – A, B, C, D, E and F. It can be used to represent large numbers with fewer digits.</p>

<p><mark>Binary Numbers</mark></p>

<p><strong>Unsigned Integer</strong>: Numbers without + or - sign, only representing the magnitude not the direction. Used when we know that the value we are storing will always be non-negative</p>

<p>Ex. 1, 2, 3, 4</p>

<p><strong>Signed Integer</strong>: The default where the variable can hold positive or negative numbers</p>

<p>Ex. -1, 6, -29, 1000</p>

<p><strong>Floating Point</strong>: Positive or negative whole number with a decimal point. Used to represent real  numbers and is written with a decimal point dividing the integer and fractional parts</p>

<p>Ex. 1.23, 87.425, and -9039454.2, NOT 101, -3, 18203</p>

<p><mark>Binary Data Abstractions</mark>:</p>

<p><strong>Boolean</strong>: Variable type that represents one of two values: True or False.</p>

<p>A = 200</p>

<p>B = 33</p>

<p>If b &gt; a:</p>

<p>print(“b is greater than a”)</p>

<p>If a &gt; b:</p>

<p>print(“a is greater than b”)</p>

<p><strong>ASCII</strong>: Stands for American Standard Code for Information Interchange. ASCII was first created when all people wanted computers to be able to show was numbers, letters, punctuation, and non-printing commands(Enter, Delete, F1).. All ASCII encoded character can be represented by 1 byte, or 8 bits for a total of 2^8 = 127 different total characters.</p>

<p>Ex. lowercase “h” character → 104 (D) → 01101000(B)</p>

<p><strong>Unicode</strong>: today, people use emojis and new symbols like other languages and stuff and computers needed to be able to represent all that. Unicode is a new standard defining an association between characters and even more numbers. Each unicode character (utf8) is 4 bytes, or 32 bits, enough for 2^32 different characters. Most modern programming languages represent strings as utf8 encoded characters (hex) because people use these new symbols in their code, but old languages like C still associat either character type with a single byte integer</p>

<p>Ex. “Hello”  → U+0048 U+0065 U+006C U+006C U+006F</p>

<p><strong>RGB</strong>: RGB (red, green, and blue) refers to a system for representing the colors to be used on a computer display.These 3 colors can be combined in various proportions to obtain any color in the visible spectrum.</p>

<p>Ex. rgb(255, 0, 0) = red because red is set to its highest value (255), and the other two (green and blue) are set to 0.</p>

<p><mark>Data Compression</mark></p>

<p><strong>Lossy</strong>: a techinique that reduces file size by discarding less important information</p>

<p><strong>Lossless (unit 3)</strong>: Every bit of data originally in a file remains after it is uncompressed, and all the information is restored.</p>
