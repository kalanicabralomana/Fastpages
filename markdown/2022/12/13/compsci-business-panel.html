<p>On Tuesday 12/13 we met 2 wonderful speakers, Kathyleen Beveridge (Project Management) and Kris Porter (Developer Operation). We learned about their very own steps to becoming the person they are today and how they have used their experience and education to advance in their fields of work. I found it really interesting how both speakers never really stayed in one field of study or field of work. They spoke about how they are always learning new concepts and learning new aspects in their fields of work. Mr. Porter gave really interesting insights about his experience as a site reliability engineer and how he was able to apply his education and what he learned to his work. Mrs. Beveridge also gave some nice insight on what she does as a Sr. Director of Marketing and how he background in engineering and STEM helps her through her work.</p>

<a class="anchor" href="#reflection" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Reflection</h1>
<p>I really liked this presentation. I thought that there was a lot to take away from both presenters. We learned about how they were able to use various element in their education and aspects they learned from their jobs to help them in STEM. One takeaway from Mrs. Beveridge that really stood out to me was her quote from Maya Angelou. “My mission in life is not merely to survive, but to thrive; and to do so with some passion, some compassion, some humor, and some style.” She explained how this quote really spoke to her and I found it interesting how she was able to apply this quote to her own life and her own passions. I feel like the aspects in this quote really speaks to me about her motivation and how she was able to climb the ranks and become as successful as she is today. I also really found it interesting how she learned about STEM which got her into the science industry and later into marketing and her job she holds today. Overall her story was really inspirational and showed me and I believe many other would also agree that her grit and determination through her passion of STEM led her career and the person she is today. Moving on to more of a computer science perspective from Mr. Porter I found his presentation also very interesting. I really like how he was able to connect what he does and produces in his job to our own computer science class and what we are currently learning. I really enjoyed how he was able to connect his business ideas to our own class. I found it really interesting how he was able to use his expertise in algorithms, deployment, and computing to connect with our very own class. One thing that I really found interesting was how he knew that he would have a chance of getting layed off after the merge of twitter after looking back a Qualcomm an their merges. I also like how he talked about his education and how he also went back to education to advance his expertise and find his very own passion. Overall I really liked both presentation and learned a lot from their life experiences and jobs in their own fields of work.</p>
