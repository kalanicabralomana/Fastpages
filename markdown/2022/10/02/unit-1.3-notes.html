<ul>
  <li>Computer programs are developed with a systematic approach to meet design elements.
    <ul>
      <li>starts with an idea</li>
      <li>follow specific steps and stick to a plan</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Dev Process can be ordered and intentional or exploratory. 
Phases of the dev process include:
    <ul>
      <li>investigating/reflecting</li>
      <li>designing</li>
      <li>prototyping</li>
      <li>testing</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Developers must determine the program requirements and constraints</li>
  <li>revisiting earlier phases of the process allows refinement and revision based on feedback and testing</li>
  <li>Break down your problem/coding process into numerous pieces and make sure each piece works before combining the program as a whole.</li>
  <li>investigation is useful to identify the program constraints and concerns for the user.
    <ul>
      <li>Collecting data with survey</li>
      <li>user testing</li>
      <li>interviews</li>
      <li>Direct Observations</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Program requirements describe user interactions and program functions
    <ul>
      <li>include user interactions and create an outline of them</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Design phase of development outlines how they will accomplish a given program goal/specification
    <ul>
      <li>brainstorming</li>
      <li>planning and creating a storyboard</li>
      <li>organizing the program into modules and functional components</li>
      <li>creation of diagrams that represent the layouts of the user interface</li>
      <li>dev of a testing strategy for the program.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>Programs are developed by groups of people and are expanded upon by individuals.
    <ul>
      <li>Rarely developed solely by a single individual. (teams are more common)</li>
      <li>Individuals work on a specific component of the program or code segment.
        <ul>
          <li>Each member of a team should receive credit in the documentation of the program</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Always acknowledge when you are using a code segment from an outside source.
    <ul>
      <li>Do this by writing the original authors name in the program documentation.</li>
      <li>Some languages have the ability to leave a comment within the code, to give credit.
        <ul>
          <li>comments make it easy to find out who is responsible to fix a specific problem</li>
          <li>After the program is completed, you can find additional bugs.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Sometimes developers use code segments, procedures, algorithms that were written by others.
    <ul>
      <li>Even if they are not part of the project, they deserve credit, because it is considered intellectual property.</li>
      <li>Documentation of contributors resembles a works cited list.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="video-3">
<a class="anchor" href="#video-3" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Video 3:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Programs use comments and documentation to explain the purpose of their programs to themselves and others</li>
  <li>Program documentation is a written description of a function of a code segment, event, procedure, or program and how it was developed.
    <ul>
      <li>Describe the overall program specifications, its development, how other programs interact with yours, and the contributors.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>You Should document your program throughout the development
    <ul>
      <li>At the beginning, list specifications</li>
      <li>During, keep track of your progress</li>
      <li>After, explain the overall  process</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Documentation helps maintain correct programs, so you can easily review what you or collaborators did.
    <ul>
      <li>Improves efficiency, and ability to test and refine your program.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>If there is no comment feature in the language, you have to get creative
    <ul>
      <li>Comments allow programmers to write text within the program, does not affect the program.</li>
      <li>Python: # is a comment</li>
      <li>Java: // is a single line comment, /* is multiple line, /** documentation comments</li>
      <li>Javascript, C++, Swift use the same as java</li>
      <li>HTML and XML use &lt;!””!&gt;</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
