</h2>

<p>1 Program purpose) Purpose to test users knowledge about the Padres 2 Data abstraction) I set a variable called correct to 0 and as the user enter correct answers it would add to that variable giving a final score in the end. 3 managing complexity) I was not able to implement this my own function. 4 procedural abstraction) I was not able to implement my own function. 5 algorithm implementation) I used if statements to change an image to a smiley face or a sad face depending on how many question were answered correct. 6 testing) I used console.log to see if everything worked orderly.</p>

<h2 id="design-process">
<a class="anchor" href="#design-process" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Design Process</h2>

<p>When we first started with Code.org we decided to plan out what 
we were going to make our quizzes about. Eventually we decided 
for one of us to do a Countries Quiz and the other do a Padres 
Quiz. For the Padres Quiz which is what I decided to create, I 
decided to have 3 different questions, 2 MC, and 1 free 
response. I decided to include a Main Screen, How to Play, 
Questions (1-3), and a Final screen.</p>

<h2 id="successes">
<a class="anchor" href="#successes" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Successes</h2>

<p>I had a few successes through coding my apps in Code.org. I 
found success in being able to direct the player to certain 
screens and coding for the right and wrong answer. At first, I 
had trouble with the text input question but I was eventually 
able to figure it out. I also thought that I was successful in 
being able to make my quiz easy to understand and easy to 
navigate through.</p>

<h2 id="discoveries">
<a class="anchor" href="#discoveries" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Discoveries</h2>

<p>Throughout the experience I became more familiar with the use 
of block coding while using the basics of Java. I see this 
experience as a fun way to navigate through block coding and 
the basics of Java.</p>

<h2 id="challenges">
<a class="anchor" href="#challenges" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Challenges</h2>

<p>I ran into a few challenges when making this quiz. One being 
showing the player if they answered correct or incorrect. At 
first I took the long way and made two different screens for an 
incorrect answer and correct answer. Later I realized that I 
should have used if then else statements to just set a picture 
to show correct or incorrect after entering the answer. I later 
displayed that in the final screen so if a player earns 3/3 
they get a smiley face and if not they get a frowny face</p>

<h2 id="calculator">

</h2>

<h2 id="design-process-1">
<a class="anchor" href="#design-process-1" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Design Process</h2>

<p>For a second app I decided to design a calculator. I went for 
more of a straight forward approach by just adding 1 screen 
with multiple buttons and text inputs. I decided to have the 4 
main calculating functions that any calculator would have. But 
I also decided to have 3 buttons that allowed you to either put 
the previous answer in the 1st number spot, 2nd number spot, or 
both.</p>

<h2 id="successes-1">
<a class="anchor" href="#successes-1" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Successes</h2>

<p>I found success in the 4 main functions since the block coding 
already had the math operators so I just had to add the 
retrieved numbers from the elements to get the answer.</p>

<h2 id="discoveries-1">
<a class="anchor" href="#discoveries-1" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Discoveries</h2>

<p>Creating a calculator as one of my apps allowed me to get more 
familiar with math functions and operators.</p>

<h2 id="challenges-1">
<a class="anchor" href="#challenges-1" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Challenges</h2>

<p>I had trouble trying to figure out how to insert the answer back into the calculator for it to be subtracted, added, etc., but eventually I figured it out by setting the text of the input as the answer.</p>
