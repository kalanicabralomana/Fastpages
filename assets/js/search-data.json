JavaScript is a loosely typed language, don&#39;t have to specify what type of information will be stored in a variable in advance. This is similar to Python and most interpretive languages. Java which is a compiled language is strongly typed, thus you will see string, integer, double, and object in the source code.

Build a Person Function/Group object and JSON . JavaScript functions have special properties and syntax is shown in many ways. In fact, a Class in JavaScript is a special function. Jupyter Notebooks seems to be more friendly to &quot;function&quot; definitions versus &quot;Class&quot;, thus this lesson uses &quot;function&quot; and &quot;prototype&quot; versus &quot;Class&quot;. .

IJavaScript and Table formatting using toHTML method . This example builds a Classroom method _toHTML which is passed to the IJavaScript interpreter $$.html which renders output similarly to a real website. . JavaScript in the _toHTML method is broken into three parts... Style part is building CSS inline formatting | Body part is constructing the Table Rows (tr), Table Headings (th), and Table Data (td).

            "content": "“Psychology and the Good Life” Notes and Insights . Insight #1: We can improve our well-being . The first insight that I took away from the video was controlling our well-being. I never knew how much control over our well-being we actually had. In a study talked about in the video, she states that around 50% of our well-being is determined by our genes. This means that people have the chance to control their well-being around half the time and affect their lives in a positive way . Insight #2: Stop worrying about the little things in life . Another insight I had while watching the video was how life circumstances don’t really affect our lives as much as we think. She talks about how these short instances in our life may affect our happiness present time when it happens but later on it takes zero control on our well-being. What we usually think will make us happy doesn’t make us as happy as we would think. . Insight #3: The importance of being with other people . In the video she mentions how happy people spend their time. It is discovered that happy people tend to spend their time around other while more unhappy people would rather spend their time alone and away from others and social interaction. She mentions a study where people that were put into a situation where they had to connect with strangers for a long period of time and they measured that their overall well being was more positive than the people that were stuck in solitary. . Insight #4: The importance of good deeds and helping other . Happy people tend to spend their time to help others. She mentions how treating and helping others has a greater affect on a persons well-being than it would if a person were to treat themselves. She mentions a study where people were given money to either help themselves or help other and the study shows that the people that helped others were significantly more happy in the end than the people that helps themselves. . Insight #5: Be present in the moment . In the video she talks about realizing what you are doing and focusing is important for you well-being. It also means taking time to realize you gratitude and what it really means to be where you are presently in that moment. . Gratitude List . Parents | Friends | Family | Community | Teammates | Coaches | Teachers | . Goals . Work on my well-being and mentality everyday | Get enough sleep | Being healthy | Be kind to others | Spread love | . Own Self Study . After we watched the video we decided to take our only little survey to see how school can affect students well-being here at Del Norte. . Below are some of the questions we asked and results that we recieved . Stress Levels . . As you can see by the data received from the students there is an incredibly high peak at the higher stress levels. Students are stressed out due to many factors that should be addressed. . Anxiety Levels . . We can see that there is a bell shaped curve residing around a level 4 anxiety. This may indicate that students aren’t too stressed out to have high anxiety but stressed out enough to relatively still have high anxiety. . Effect of homework . . As we can see by this pie chart a majority of students are overwhelmed by their homework whether it be the amount of homework or the difficulty of it. . Loneliness . . We can see that around two thirds of students that answered this survey responded yes to being lonely. This may suggest unhappy students to to social interactions and connections being important to a persons happiness. . Takeaway . From this little study we conducted as a team we were able to conclude that school does take a toll on the students mental health. But it is more about how the student handles it. The student may be able to handle everything and not be overwhelmed by work but did they answer yes on feeling lonely if that was the case. This survey gave us the chance to analyze students well-being while relating it to the video of the Psychology of a Good Life. .",

Padres Quiz . 1 Program purpose) Purpose to test users knowledge about the Padres 2 Data abstraction) I set a variable called correct to 0 and as the user enter correct answers it would add to that variable giving a final score in the end. 3 managing complexity) I was not able to implement this my own function. 4 procedural abstraction) I was not able to implement my own function. 5 algorithm implementation) I used if statements to change an image to a smiley face or a sad face depending on how many question were answered correct. 6 testing) I used console.log to see if everything worked orderly. . Design Process . When we first started with Code.org we decided to plan out what we were going to make our quizzes about. Eventually we decided for one of us to do a Countries Quiz and the other do a Padres Quiz. For the Padres Quiz which is what I decided to create, I decided to have 3 different questions, 2 MC, and 1 free response. I decided to include a Main Screen, How to Play, Questions (1-3), and a Final screen. . Successes . I had a few successes through coding my apps in Code.org. I found success in being able to direct the player to certain screens and coding for the right and wrong answer. At first, I had trouble with the text input question but I was eventually able to figure it out. I also thought that I was successful in being able to make my quiz easy to understand and easy to navigate through. . Discoveries . Throughout the experience I became more familiar with the use of block coding while using the basics of Java. I see this experience as a fun way to navigate through block coding and the basics of Java. . Challenges . I ran into a few challenges when making this quiz. One being showing the player if they answered correct or incorrect. At first I took the long way and made two different screens for an incorrect answer and correct answer. Later I realized that I should have used if then else statements to just set a picture to show correct or incorrect after entering the answer. I later displayed that in the final screen so if a player earns 3/3 they get a smiley face and if not they get a frowny face . Calculator . Design Process . For a second app I decided to design a calculator. I went for more of a straight forward approach by just adding 1 screen with multiple buttons and text inputs. I decided to have the 4 main calculating functions that any calculator would have. But I also decided to have 3 buttons that allowed you to either put the previous answer in the 1st number spot, 2nd number spot, or both. . Successes . I found success in the 4 main functions since the block coding already had the math operators so I just had to add the retrieved numbers from the elements to get the answer. . Discoveries . Creating a calculator as one of my apps allowed me to get more familiar with math functions and operators. . Challenges . I had trouble trying to figure out how to insert the answer back into the calculator for it to be subtracted, added, etc., but eventually I figured it out by setting the text of the input as the answer. .",

I also noticed that all of my posts moved to the left of my fastpages site. I also noticed that the formatting and text font changed. I liked how the title of my site was centered at the top of my screen. The only thing that I didn’t liek was how there is empty space on the right side of the site. Overall I like how nicer and cleaner the theme is compared to minima. . Search Feature . . When using the search page I am able to type in any key word that shows up throughout my fastpages website. In this case, I typed in fastpages and the page outputs links to any post, notebook, page and/or markdown that contains fastpages in it. . Tags . . As you can see I have tags for notesbooks that incule code in them as well as corresponding weeks for the different assignments. .",

            "content": "Thesis: . In her poem “Prayer for My Immigrant Relatives,” Bedikian establishes the usage of imagery to demonstrate how immigrants may feel unwelcome and unwanted rather than embraced and aided when entering America. . Paragraph: . The use of imagery demonstrates American culture as deterring, representing how Americans may disdain immigration. For example, when Bedikian writes, “peoples’ words resemble the buzz of beehives,” (lines 6-7). The writer implies that to the ears of her immigrant relatives, hearing the language intimidates them, similar to the effect that a beehive enacts on someone. The buzz of the beehive may also be interpreted as the chaos of the immigration process, helping to resemble the difficulties immigrants must face while achieving the American Dream. The author also writes, “help them to hear the music of home sung from balconies overflowing with woven rugs and bundled vegetables.” (lines 1-3). In these lines, Bedikian focuses more on her immigrant relatives missing home and distracting themselves. Bedikian writes about their home as a place of elegance and comfort. This helps exemplify how hard it may be for the immigrant relatives to assimilate into the new American culture while also maintaining balance with their own culture. Also, by formatting the poem as a prayer it helps represent the stressful situation, due to people dedicating prayer in times of distress. Overall, Bedikian’s usage of imagery assists her poem in validating the immigration process to America as somewhat unwelcoming and detering. .",

With fastpages you can save your jupyter notebooks into the _notebooks folder at the root of your repository, and they will be automatically be converted to Jekyll compliant blog posts! . Front Matter . The first cell in your Jupyter Notebook or markdown blog post contains front matter. Front matter is metadata that can turn on/off options in your Notebook. It is formatted like this: . # &quot;My Title&quot; &gt; &quot;Awesome summary&quot; - toc:true- branch: master - badges: true - comments: true - author: Hamel Husain &amp; Jeremy Howard - categories: [fastpages, jupyter] . Setting toc: true will automatically generate a table of contents | Setting badges: true will automatically include GitHub and Google Colab links to your notebook. | Setting comments: true will enable commenting on your blog post, powered by utterances. | . The title and description need to be enclosed in double quotes only if they include special characters such as a colon. More details and options for front matter can be viewed on the front matter section of the README. . Markdown Shortcuts . A #hide comment at the top of any code cell will hide both the input and output of that cell in your blog post. . A #hide_input comment at the top of any code cell will only hide the input of that cell. . The comment #hide_input was used to hide the code that produced this. . put a #collapse-hide flag at the top of any cell if you want to hide that cell by default, but give the reader the option to show it: . import pandas as pd import altair as alt . . put a #collapse-show flag at the top of any cell if you want to show that cell by default, but give the reader the option to hide it: . cars = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/cars.json&#39; movies = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/movies.json&#39; sp500 = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/sp500.csv&#39; stocks = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/stocks.csv&#39; flights = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/flights-5k.json&#39; . . place a #collapse-output flag at the top of any cell if you want to put the output under a collapsable element that is closed by default, but give the reader the option to open it: . print(&#39;The comment #collapse-output was used to collapse the output of this cell by default but you can expand it.&#39;) . The comment #collapse-output was used to collapse the output of this cell by default but you can expand it. . . Interactive Charts With Altair . Charts made with Altair remain interactive. Example charts taken from this repo, specifically this notebook. . Example 1: DropDown . # use specific hard-wired values as the initial selected values selection = alt.selection_single( name=&#39;Select&#39;, fields=[&#39;Major_Genre&#39;, &#39;MPAA_Rating&#39;], init={&#39;Major_Genre&#39;: &#39;Drama&#39;, &#39;MPAA_Rating&#39;: &#39;R&#39;}, bind={&#39;Major_Genre&#39;: alt.binding_select(options=genres), &#39;MPAA_Rating&#39;: alt.binding_radio(options=mpaa)} ) # scatter plot, modify opacity based on selection alt.Chart(df).mark_circle().add_selection( selection ).encode( x=&#39;Rotten_Tomatoes_Rating:Q&#39;, y=&#39;IMDB_Rating:Q&#39;, tooltip=&#39;Title:N&#39;, opacity=alt.condition(selection, alt.value(0.75), alt.value(0.05)) ) . Example 2: Tooltips . alt.Chart(df).mark_circle().add_selection( alt.selection_interval(bind=&#39;scales&#39;, encodings=[&#39;x&#39;]) ).encode( alt.X(&#39;Rotten_Tomatoes_Rating&#39;, type=&#39;quantitative&#39;), alt.Y(&#39;IMDB_Rating&#39;, type=&#39;quantitative&#39;, axis=alt.Axis(minExtent=30)), # y=alt.Y(&#39;IMDB_Rating:Q&#39;, ), # use min extent to stabilize axis title placement tooltip=[&#39;Title:N&#39;, &#39;Release_Date:N&#39;, &#39;IMDB_Rating:Q&#39;, &#39;Rotten_Tomatoes_Rating:Q&#39;] ).properties( width=500, height=400 ) . Example 3: More Tooltips . label = alt.selection_single( encodings=[&#39;x&#39;], # limit selection to x-axis value on=&#39;mouseover&#39;, # select on mouseover events nearest=True, # select data point nearest the cursor empty=&#39;none&#39; # empty selection includes no data points ) # define our base line chart of stock prices base = alt.Chart().mark_line().encode( alt.X(&#39;date:T&#39;), alt.Y(&#39;price:Q&#39;, scale=alt.Scale(type=&#39;log&#39;)), alt.Color(&#39;symbol:N&#39;) ) alt.layer( base, # base line chart # add a rule mark to serve as a guide line alt.Chart().mark_rule(color=&#39;#aaa&#39;).encode( x=&#39;date:T&#39; ).transform_filter(label), # add circle marks for selected time points, hide unselected points base.mark_circle().encode( opacity=alt.condition(label, alt.value(1), alt.value(0)) ).add_selection(label), # add white stroked text to provide a legible background for labels base.mark_text(align=&#39;left&#39;, dx=5, dy=-5, stroke=&#39;white&#39;, strokeWidth=2).encode( text=&#39;price:Q&#39; ).transform_filter(label), # add text labels for stock prices base.mark_text(align=&#39;left&#39;, dx=5, dy=-5).encode( text=&#39;price:Q&#39; ).transform_filter(label), data=stocks ).properties( width=500, height=400 ) .

This guide provides more detail about this syntax, which looks like this: . For example, here is a footnote {% fn 1 %}. And another {% fn 2 %} {{ &#39;This is the footnote.&#39; | fndetail: 1 }} {{ &#39;This is the other footnote. You can even have a [link](www.github.com)!&#39; | fndetail: 2 }} .

            "content": "Example Markdown Post . Basic setup . Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format: . YEAR-MONTH-DAY-filename.md . Where YEAR is a four-digit number, MONTH and DAY are both two-digit numbers, and filename is whatever file name you choose, to remind yourself what this post is about. .md is the file extension for markdown files. . The first line of the file should start with a single hash character, then a space, then your title. This is how you create a “level 1 heading” in markdown. Then you can create level 2, 3, etc headings as you wish but repeating the hash character, such as you see in the line ## File names above. . Basic formatting . You can use italics, bold, code font text, and create links. Here’s a footnote 1. Here’s a horizontal rule: . . Lists . Here’s a list: . item 1 | item 2 | . And a numbered list: . item 1 | item 2 | Boxes and stuff . This is a quotation . . You can include alert boxes …and… . . You can include info boxes Images . . Code . You can format text and code per usual . General preformatted text: . # Do a thing do_thing() . Python code and output: . # Prints &#39;2&#39; print(1+1) . 2 . Formatting text as shell commands: . echo &quot;hello world&quot; ./some_script.sh --option &quot;value&quot; wget https://example.com/cat_photo1.png .
