<p>Question: How do you think we should find the difference of two binary numbers? The product? The quotient? What rules need to be followed for those operations? Look into all of this on the Internet and note down important information you find (0.45)</p>
<p>We should find the difference of two binary numbers by adding the 2's complement of the second number to the first number. Binary subtraction is just binary addition of a negative number. To find the difference, the overflow bit is discarded and the rest of the answer is taken as the solution. You can take the product of two binary numbers by shifting the multiplicand left appropriately for each non-zero bit in the multiplier, and then adding the shifted numbers together. You can take the quotient of two binary numbers by comparing the divisor and dividend. If the divisor is larger, place 0 as the quotient, then bring the second bit of the dividend down. If the divisor is smaller, multiply it with 1 and the result becomes the subtrahend. Then, subtract the subtrahend from the minuend to get the remainder. Then bring down the next number bit from the dividend portion and perform step 1 again. Repeat the same process until the remainder becomes zero or the whole dividend is divided.</p>
<p>Based on what you find online, fill out the tables below for subtracting, multiplying, and dividing binary numbers (0.45):
Subtracting Rules: 0, 1, 1, 1, 0
Multiplying Rules: 1, 0, 0, 0
Dividing Rules: 1, 0</p>

<p>Answer these questions in your blog:</p>
<p>1.How can logic gates be used to execute basic computer functions?(1-2 sentences)</p>
<p>Logic gates are the building blocks of digital circuits and can be used to execute basic computer functions by combining them to create more complex circuits that can perform logical operations such as AND, OR, NOT, and XOR, which are used in various computer operations like arithmetic, memory storage, and communication.</p>
<p>2.What is the difference between boolean operations and logic gates?(1-2 sentences)</p>
<p>Boolean operations are mathematical operations that are performed on boolean values (true or false), while logic gates are physical electronic components that implement boolean functions and perform logical operations on binary inputs (0 or 1) to produce binary outputs. Boolean operations are an abstract concept, while logic gates are the physical implementation of boolean operations.</p>
<p>3.Complete this quiz and correct any mistakes in your blog</p>
<p>Nothing to correct got all question right</p>

<p>Github pages is a hosting service website. Search up another hosting service website other than Github's and write at least one benefit, advantage, or feature that is different from other hosting service websites.</p>
<p>One advantage of using Netlify as a hosting service is that it offers continuous deployment, which means that it automatically deploys updates to your website whenever you push changes to your Git repository. This makes the deployment process faster and more streamlined, without the need for manual intervention. Additionally, Netlify offers a range of features such as form handling, A/B testing, and built-in CDN, which make it a popular choice among developers for hosting static websites and applications.</p>
