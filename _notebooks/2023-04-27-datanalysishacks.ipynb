    "1. make your own data using your brian, google or chatgpt, should look different than mine.\n",
    "2. modify my code or write your own\n",
    "3. output your data other than a bar graph.\n",
    "4. answer the questions below, the more explained the better.\n",
    "### Questions (0.9)\n",
    "1. What are the two primary data structures in pandas and how do they differ?\n",
    "- The two primary data structures in pandas are CSV files and databases.\n",
    "2. How do you read a CSV file into a pandas DataFrame?\n",
    "- To read a CSV file into a pandas DataFrame, you can use the read_csv function in pandas.\n",
    "3. How do you select a single column from a pandas DataFrame?\n",
    "- To select a single column from a pandas DataFrame, you can use the indexing operator [] with the column name\n",
    "4. How do you filter rows in a pandas DataFrame based on a condition?\n",
    "- To filter rows in a pandas DataFrame based on a condition, you can use boolean indexing.\n",
    "5. How do you group rows in a pandas DataFrame by a particular column?\n",
    "- To group rows in a pandas DataFrame by a particular column, you can use the groupby method.\n",
    "6. How do you aggregate data in a pandas DataFrame using functions like sum and mean?\n",
    "- To aggregate data in a pandas DataFrame using functions like sum and mean, you can use the agg method.\n",
    "7. How do you handle missing values in a pandas DataFrame?\n",
    "- To handle missing values in a pandas DataFrame, you can use the fillna method to fill in missing values with a specific value or method, or you can use the dropna method to remove rows with missing values.\n",
    "8. How do you merge two pandas DataFrames together?\n",
    "- To merge two pandas DataFrames together, you can use the merge method\n",
    "9. How do you export a pandas DataFrame to a CSV file?\n",
    "- To export a pandas DataFrame to a CSV file, you can use the to_csv method\n",
    "10. What is the difference between a Series and a DataFrame in Pandas?\n",
    "- The main difference between a Series and a DataFrame in pandas is that a Series is a one-dimensional array-like object, while a DataFrame is a two-dimensional table-like data structure. A Series can be thought of as a single column of a DataFrame, while a DataFrame can have multiple columns."
